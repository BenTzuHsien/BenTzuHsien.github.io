I am a master’s student in Robotics at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Prof. Karthik Desingh](https://karthikdesingh.com/) at the [Robotics Perception and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io/). My long-term research goal is to develop learning-based **mobile manipulation** policies that enable robots to perform everyday tasks in human environments. To achieve this goal, my current research directions include:

- **Last-meter navigation**  
  Bridging the gap between navigation and manipulation by positioning robots precisely enough for downstream manipulation. My work focuses on learning navigation policies that enable manipulation policies to operate beyond stationary settings.

- **Data-efficient imitation learning for manipulation**  
  Improving the sample efficiency and generalization of learning-based manipulation policies. I study how manipulation policies can be trained with minimal supervision, such as a small number of demonstrations, while still generalizing robustly to unseen objects and environments.


### Background and Experience

I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in the physical principles underlying robotic systems, including dynamics, control, and state estimation. During my undergraduate years, I served as the software lead of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) student team, where I gained extensive hands-on experience with real-world robotic systems.

In this role, I designed and maintained the software architecture spanning perception, estimation, control, and navigation, and worked extensively with embedded systems and low-level programming. I am particularly comfortable with C and C++ for real-time and embedded applications, as well as Python for higher-level robotics and learning pipelines. This experience shaped my interest in building robotic systems that operate reliably outside controlled laboratory settings.
